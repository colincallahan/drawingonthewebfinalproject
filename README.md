 My goal with this project is to take the observer on a **journey into space** using CSS animations, sounds clips, and SVG and raster graphics.  The navigation will have three tabs: _“launch”, “space”, and “descend”_.  The first page will have a button that says _“blast off”_ which starts the launch phase.  This will trigger a visible number countdown, and sounds of a space shuttle blasting off.  In addition, you will see an animation of a space shuttle launching from the bottom of the screen to the top of the screen.  The user will then press the _“space”_ tab to go to the next phase.  There you will see planets and stars in the sky.  By hovering over each planet it will enlarge slightly and you will hear a distinct sound clip.  I will use my **music and sound design **background to **compose original 10-15 second sound clips** that are unique to each planet or star that you can observe.  I would like to render the **planets as rotating spheres in CSS**.  When the user is done being in space they can click the _“descend”_ tab to load the page to go back to earth.  This page will be an animation of the space shuttle coming back to Earth and landing in the ocean.  It will have audio of the rocket sound and landing back on the planet Earth.
