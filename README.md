My goal with this project is to take the
observer on a journey into space using _CSS
animations_, _sounds clips_, and _SVG_.  The navigation will have
three tabs: **“launch”**, **“space”**, and **“descend”**.  The first page will have a button that says “blast
off” which starts the launch phase.  This will trigger the animation of
the space ship going up into space.  I will create the space ship and
backdrop using SVG and div tag shapes to create an aesthetically minimal
design. You will see an animation of a space shuttle launching from the
bottom of the screen to the top of the screen.  The user will then press
the “space” tab to go to the next phase.  There you will see planets and
stars in the sky.  These will be created using SVG.  By hovering over
each planet you will hear a distinct sound clip.  I will use my music and
sound design background to compose _original
10-15 second sound clip_s that are unique to each planet that you can
observe.  When the user is done in space they can click the “descend” tab
to load the page to go back to earth.  This page will be an animation of
the space shuttle coming back to Earth.  This again will be made with SVG
shapes and div tag shapes.  The current screenshots are for reference and
those images will not be used in the final project as SVG will replace those
images.
